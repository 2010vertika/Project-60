        <p> My Hobby is painting in my free time.I am 11 years old. I am studying 6th standard.
            I like painting. It makes me feel relaxed. I paint pictures,sceneries,nature etc. I like to make painting of different things. In the beginning, I wasn't able to paint properly.But now, my painting is wel improved.My mother and father love my paintings and sometimes my sister also helps in it. I have many Hobbies like studying,playing games but Painting is my Favourite hobby and i love to the see the result of the painting after I paint.It takes practice, experience and observation. Painting can stimulate your imagination, inspiring you to explore how you interpret the world.
